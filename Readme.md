# Makeup

Makeup provides markup rendering and syntax highlighting in one glorious
package. It can also syntax highlight "fenced code blocks" in markdown files.

`Makeup` does all its heavylifting through `GitHub::Markup` and `Pygments.rb`,
and combines the two for killer code blocks in markup files.
